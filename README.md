## Overview

The 'bnxFortran' package provides some C functions that wrap Fortran algorithms.
These interface functions are implemented here to be called directly from the
C or C++ source code level of other R packages.

### Background

This package has been created with at least two main purposes in mind:

A) Using R's `R_RegisterCCallable` to enable function calling at the the source
  code (`src`) level of other R packages.
B) Placing all *Fortran* algorithms needed by the *BioNumeriX (BNX)* R packages
  and associated C/C++ wrapper functions at a central place for maintenance and
  reusability.
C) ... (etc.).

### Status

Currently, the following *Fortran* algorithms are wrapped and can be called from
C/C++ source code within other packages (`src`) source code:

- `nnls`: the Lawson-Hanson NNLS implemention of non-negative least squares
  written by CL Lawson & RJ Hanson (1995) with modifications by KM Mullen & IHM
  van Stokkum
  (CRAN [nnls](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nnls/index.html)).
- `akima` algorithms ACM 433 and 697: the "original" (ACM 433, Akima 1970) or
  "improved" method (ACM 697, Akima 1991) after H Akima originally ported to R
  by A Gebhardt *et. al.*
  (CRAN [akima](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/akima/index.html)).

Possible improvements, additions as well as next steps are listed in the
[TODO.md](TODO.md) file.

## Install

Stable releases of this package are usually made available at and can be
installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) using R via the standard

``` r
# The most-likely easiest way to get this package installed:
install.packages("bnxFortran")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix, or use a feature from the latest development version, you can
install this package from GitHub using:

``` r
## Installation from source gets you the latest (developmental) fixes:
# You may need to pre-install all necessary dependencies (if any is missing).
# You may need to set `httr::set_config(httr::config(ssl_verifypeer = 0L))`.
if (!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bionumerix/bnxFortran")
```

Alternatively, you can install the release of the latest development version
from the *BioNumeriX (BNX)* R repository (under development) via:

``` r
## Currently under development:
install.packages("bnxFortran", repos = "http://bionumerix.github.io/uran")
```

## Cheatsheet

Under development.

## Usage

Under development. See the documentation and vignettes (if any).
